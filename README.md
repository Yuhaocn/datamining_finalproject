# datamining_finalproject
The goal of this experiment is to develop a classifier to predict disease class base on gene dataset we have. Gene data will be cleaned on certain rules and filter by ANOVA test and sorted a set of numbers of genes from different classes. Performances of the classifier is measured by cross validate score on training data. Predictions are generated by the chosen classifier using adaptive boosting for further study.
